When combined with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), the system can automatically manage the lifecycle of SSL/TLS certificates, including issuance, renewal, and deployment across AWS services.
For web applications deployed on EC2 with MongoDB Atlas databases, implementing KMS encryption ensures that sensitive information such as connection strings, user credentials, payment data, and personal information is protected at an enterprise level.</description></item><item><title>Protect web applications with AWS WAF</title><link>https://thanhlong1512.github.io/Workshop-AWS/4-securitymonitoring/4.2-aws-waf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thanhlong1512.github.io/Workshop-AWS/4-securitymonitoring/4.2-aws-waf/</guid><description>Introduction AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a powerful cloud security service designed to protect your web applications from common cyberattacks and malicious traffic. Operating at the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model), AWS WAF provides granular control over HTTP/HTTPS traffic to your application.
Why Use AWS WAF? In today&amp;rsquo;s increasingly complex cybersecurity landscape, web applications face various types of attacks:
