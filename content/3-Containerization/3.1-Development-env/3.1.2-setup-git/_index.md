**GitHub** is a specialized social network for developers, serving as a project management and source code hosting platform that enables collaboration in software projects. Additionally, GitHub is a well-known service that provides Git-based source code repositories for software projects. It includes all the features of Git while also adding social features to facilitate interaction among developers.

**Git** is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) and one of the most popular version control systems today. Git provides each developer with their own repository containing the full history of changes.

    3. **Working with Repositories**

       - **Creating a New Repository**
         When creating a new repository, ensure the name is unique within your repository list and add a description. By default, GitHub creates a public repository, but you can change its visibility before or after creation.

         Now, create two repositories named:**AWS-FE và AWS-BE**

         After creation, go to: **Home -> Avatar sát bên tay phải -> Your Repositories**
         ![GitHub](/images/3.Containerization/3.1/3.1.2/5.png)
         If both repositories appear, congratulations—you’ve successfully created them!
